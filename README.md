Lending Club, a consumer finance marketplace specializing in offering a variety of loans to urban customers, faces a critical challenge in managing its loan approval process. When evaluating loan applications, the company must make sound decisions to minimize financial losses, primarily stemming from loans extended to applicants who are considered "risky."

These financial losses, referred to as credit losses, occur when borrowers fail to repay their loans or default. In simpler terms, borrowers labeled as "charged-off" are the ones responsible for the most significant losses to the company.

The primary objective of this exercise is to assist Lending Club in mitigating credit losses. This challenge arises from two potential scenarios:

Identifying applicants likely to repay their loans is crucial, as they can generate profits for the company through interest payments. Rejecting such applicants would result in a loss of potential business.
On the other hand, approving loans for applicants not likely to repay and at risk of default can lead to substantial financial losses for the company.
